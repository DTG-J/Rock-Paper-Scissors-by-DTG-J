A console game "Rock - Paper - Scissors"
Rock - Paper - Scissors is a two player game where your opponent (the computer) and you choose at the same time one of the next three options: "rock", "paper" or "scissors". The rules are the folloing:
• Rock beats scissors (the scissors get smashed by the rock)
• Scissors beats paper (the paper is cut by the scissors)
• Paper beats rock (the paper covers the rock)
The winner is player whose choice beats the others. If both players choose the same option
(e.g. "paper"), the game outcome is a "draw".
